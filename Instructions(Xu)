After you have all the data, try to complete the following...


1) In the customers table, keep only 3 customers, we don't need too many
2) Similarly, keep only 1 or 2 staff members
3) Add username and password attributes to each of the customers and staff attributes (make them simple enough so that at least you remember them)
4) Create an function(sql/java) to check whether the entered username and password mathches any of the ones in the customer or staff table
5) If it does, return all the information attributes of that person in a Result Set. Also set the local variable user = 1 for customer and user = 2 for staff (variable is already defined in the class)
6) If it does not match anyone, set user = 0
7) Write sql code to add a new customer to the database.
8) In the products table, besides what we have, we need to add 2 more attributes. Those are "image" and "nutrition." So see if you can think about how we should do those.

That's all I can think of for now.. If I add more, I'll do so below this line and send you a message.
